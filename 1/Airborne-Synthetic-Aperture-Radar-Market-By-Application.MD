Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Market Overview
Synthetic aperture radar is used for creation of 2D or 3D reconstruction of a landscape or an object. Synthetic aperture radar is a space borne or airborne radar system, which generates remote sensory image with high resolution. Synthetic aperture radar or SAR system gathers data of the flight path to stimulate aperture or large antenna electronically. It operates similar to phased array. However, instead of large number of parallel antennas, synthetic aperture radar uses one antenna in time multiplex. Synthetic aperture radar gathers data from different geographical locations which result into full moving platform. It is also used in defense systems for earth resource mapping, environmental monitoring, etc. Airborne synthetic aperture radar helps in gathering information about the land & ocean with the help of sensors, which are equipped into airborne platforms such as aircrafts, balloons, and UAVs.This report provides a deep insight into the global Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar market covering all its essential aspects.
