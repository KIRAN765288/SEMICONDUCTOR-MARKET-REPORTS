-Semiconductor IP Market Overview

Semiconductor intellectual property (IP), also known as IP cores are the reusable design components. Semiconductor IP is used to build advanced integrated circuits (ICÂ’s). These design components are traded as rights to use and copy the design, and hence called as the intellectual property. These IP cores are combined to create system on chip (SoCs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and application specific standard products (ASSPs).This report provides a deep insight into the global Semiconductor IP market covering all its essential aspects.
