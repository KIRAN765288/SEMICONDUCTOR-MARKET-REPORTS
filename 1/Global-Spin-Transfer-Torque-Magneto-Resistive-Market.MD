Spin-Transfer Torque Magneto Resistive RAM (STT-MRAM) Market Overview

Spin-Transfer Torque Magneto Resistive RAM (STT-MRAM) (also called STT-RAM or sometimes ST-MRAM and ST-RAM) is an advanced type of MRAM devices. STT-MRAM enables higher densities, low power consumption and reduced cost compared to regular (so-called Toggle MRAM) devices. The main advantage of STT-MRAM over Toggle MRAM is the ability to scale the STT-MRAM chips to achieve higher densities at a lower cost. STT-MRAM has the potential to become a leading storage technology as it is a high-performance memory (can challenge DRAM and SRAM) that can scale well below 10nm and challenge the low cost of flash memory.This report provides a deep insight into the global Spin-Transfer Torque Magneto Resistive RAM (STT-MRAM) market covering all its essential aspects.
