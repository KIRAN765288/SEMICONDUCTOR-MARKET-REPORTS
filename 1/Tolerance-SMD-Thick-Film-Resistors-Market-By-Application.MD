FAQS ; 

. What are 1% and 5% tolerance SMD thick film resistors?

1% and 5% tolerance SMD (Surface Mount Device) thick film resistors are electronic components that regulate electrical current in circuits. The tolerance percentage indicates the acceptable deviation from the stated resistance valueâ€”1% resistors are more precise than 5% resistors.

2. What are the key advantages of SMD thick film resistors?

These resistors offer space efficiency, ease of automated PCB assembly, cost-effectiveness, and stable performance under various conditions. Compared to thin film resistors, thick film resistors are more durable and cost-efficient for general applications.

3. What is driving the growth of the 1% and 5% tolerance SMD thick film resistors market?

The increasing demand for electronic devices, including consumer electronics, telecommunications equipment, and automotive electronics, is driving market growth. The rise of IoT, 5G networks, and electric vehicles also boosts demand for these resistors.

4. What is the projected market size of the industry by 2030?

The global market for 1% and 5% tolerance SMD thick film resistors is expected to grow from USD 1,197 million in 2023 to USD 1,776.21 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 5.80%.

5. Which regions are leading in the 1% and 5% tolerance SMD thick film resistors market?

North America, Asia-Pacific, and Europe are major players, with North America having a market size of USD 311.90 million in 2023. Asia-Pacific, particularly China, Japan, and South Korea, leads in production and consumption.
